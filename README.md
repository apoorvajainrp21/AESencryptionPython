AES Encryption using Python.
Hey, this is Apoorva. I have coded this on Google Collab. 

The code starts with a basic Symmetric encryption. Yoou upload a file, chose to encrypt or decrypt the contents of that file. Make sure you include the file extension before choosing to encrypt or decrypt.
Next, the AES algorithm is introduces. A little introduction on AES:
**The AES( Advanced Encryption Standard)** is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used to secure data. It was established by NIST in2001, Aes was designed to replace the outdated DES algorithm.

Some **key features** include: 
1. AES uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
2. Aes operates on fixed-size blocks of data(128 bits), regardless of the input size.
3. AES supports three key lengths: 128 bits, 192 bits, 256 bits. Longer keys provide greater security.
4. AES uses a combination of subsitution and permutation operations.

The code starts by importing some neccessary libraries. Then I have created a function to generate the AES key from the password input by the user. Next, I have created a function to encrypt the file. Then, a function for decrypting the file is written. 
I have also added some UI components to make the user interface better.

Thank you,
Apoorva Jain
